The GAP 4 package `UnitTests'
==============================

The goal of this package is to provide a unit test framework for GAP
and GAP packages. As such, it is not meant to replace the existing
test functionality in GAP, but rather to complement it.

This package is still in early development. Feedback on its design
and functionality, as well as pull requests and patches, are highly
welcome. The latest version can always be found at
